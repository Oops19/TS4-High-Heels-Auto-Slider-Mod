Do not delete the 'do-not-delte.this-file.txt' file after creation. The default slider values are stored here.
If it get's lost then the mod has no idea about the default settings.
It could assume that '0' instead of the current slider value is the default but this is not implemented.
This requires that the used slider is only used by the mod and never in CAS. Currently this is the case but with support for custom sliders things may change.
