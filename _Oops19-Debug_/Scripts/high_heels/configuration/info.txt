This is the configuration directory.
If you ever receive heels or other CC with a "preset.creator.ini" file then store this file here.


The file 'do-not-delete-this-file.txt' should not be deleted. The sim default slider values are stored in it.
If you delete it while sliders are applied in your save-game the mod will assume that the applied values are the default values.
The 'up''-slider default should be 0 for all sims while the 'tall'-slider may have random values.

This mod is delivered with:
"slider.default.ini" which defines the sliders delivered with this mod.
"perset.default.ini" which contains presets for nearly all EA shoes / heels (base game and many mods).
    Flat shoes are not included for obvious reasons. There the same default as for 'nude' is applied. Even though also "flat" shoes usually add 10 to 30 mm.

This mod may include:
"preset.asta96.ini" which defines preset for some Astya96 heels. Heels are not included.
"preset.DallasGirl79.ini" which defines preset for some DallasGirl79 heels. Heels are not included.
"preset.redheadsims.ini" which defines presets for some redheadsims heels. Heels are included (licenced according to https://tos.ea.com/legalapp/WEBTERMS/US/en/PC/).

See Oops19-Documentation/Used_CC.txt for more information about used CC.
