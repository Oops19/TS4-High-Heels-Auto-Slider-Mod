# Oops19 High Heels Mod - FNV Utility
The FNV utility allows to generate FNV values on the fly.

To use it in TS4 open the 'Cheat Console' (Ctrl+Shift+C) and enter:
```
o19.fnv Text
```

It prints various FNV values to the console.

The code is not meant to be used in TS4 as the standard TS4 hash functions are likely much faster.

It supports UTF-8 or UCS-2, conversion to lower case and setting of the high-bit.
